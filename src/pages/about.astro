        This site grows from the mahāvākya "Ayam Ātmā Brahma" – this very self is Brahman –
        and from the conviction that clarity is a form of devotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, Upaniṣadic Vedānta is explored with the tools of a scientist and philosopher:
        careful definitions, explicit arguments, and an honest dialogue with modern physics,
        chemistry, and cognitive science.

      <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Most introductions to Vedānta either water down the teaching for Western audiences
        or assume familiarity with Sanskrit and traditional commentary. This site attempts
        a third path: rigorous fidelity to the source texts, expressed in language that
        a philosopher or scientist would recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not to "prove" Vedānta with science, nor to dismiss science as māyā.
        It is simply to think clearly – to use whatever tools sharpen understanding.

      <h3>Science & Vedānta</h3>
      <p>
        Reflections at the intersection of consciousness studies, physics, and
