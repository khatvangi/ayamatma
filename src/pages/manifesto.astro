      <p>
        Two centuries of colonial and Abrahamic grammar have distorted how Indian philosophy is discussed.
        This platform does not use that grammar. If a word has no Sanskrit equivalent that maps cleanly,
        we treat it with suspicion.

    <h2 class="protocol-title">On Truth</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>Truth is not democratic. It does not arise from consensus. It does not wait for approval. It does not negotiate with majority.</p>
      <p>Truth is not moral. Not benevolent. Not cruel. Not kind. Not harsh. Those belong to agents. Truth has no agency.</p>
      <p>Truth is not sentimental. It did not arise to console you. It did not arise to heal you. It did not arise to protect your feelings. Those are functions you project onto it.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Satya</em> is what is.</strong> Not "what ought to be said nicely." Not "what helps." Not "what unifies." What is — irrespective of who likes it, survives it, or benefits from it.</p>
      <p>Kindness is not truth. Truthfulness may require kindness. That is a discipline of the speaker. It is not a property of truth. To confuse the two is to moralize ontology.</p>
      <p><strong>Individuals do not launder structures.</strong> A gentle pope does not fix Christian theology. A compassionate imam does not fix Islamic metaphysics. A serene yogi does not fix a flawed <em>dharmic</em> formulation. Persons are contingent. Structures persist. Truth adjudicates structures, not personalities.</p>
      <p>Truth is non-polar. Good/bad. Kind/cruel. Harsh/soft. These are <em>dvandvas</em> — products of comparative minds under limitation. Tools for navigation, not features of reality. When you say "this truth is harsh," you report your reaction. You do not describe truth.</p>
      <p><strong>Polarity belongs to cognition, not to being.</strong></p>
      <p>Truth has no preference vector. It does not lean. It does not oppose. It does not balance. Those are relational descriptions from observers in limited frames.</p>
      <p>Truth removes polarity without offering replacement. The mind, which lives by contrasts, calls this cruelty. That reaction is diagnostic. It reveals dependence on <em>dvandva</em>. It does not reveal a defect in truth.</p>
      <p><strong>This is not harshness. This is clarity.</strong></p>
      <p>Truth stands, whether it is seen or not.</p>

    <h2 class="protocol-title">On Authority</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>An argument stands on its logic and its alignment with <em>satya</em>. The speaker's status is irrelevant.</p>
      <p>We respect <em>paramparā</em> as a method of transmission, not a hierarchy of holiness.</p>
      <p>When Ācāryas disagree, we study the disagreement. Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva are interlocutors, not team jerseys.</p>
      <p><strong>If a teaching cannot withstand questioning, it is not teaching. It is repetition.</strong></p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section protocol">
    <h2 class="protocol-title">On Science</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>Science describes the measurable. Vedānta investigates the measurer.</p>
      <p>Different domains. Different tools. We do not blur them.</p>
      <p>Quantum mechanics is not <em>Māyā</em>. Neuroplasticity is not proof of <em>Ātman</em>. We use scientific analogies as <em>dṛṣṭānta</em> when they clarify. We discard them when they distort.</p>
      <p><strong>Where Vedānta makes claims about the physical world, we defer to observation. Where it speaks of the observer, observation cannot reach.</strong></p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section protocol">
    <h2 class="protocol-title">On Language</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>Sanskrit terms carry structure that translations destroy.</p>
      <p><em>Ātman</em> is not "Soul." <em>Dharma</em> is not just "Duty." <em>Mokṣa</em> is not "Liberation." None of these terms have English equivalents.</p>
      <p>We use the original terms. We define them. We expect you to learn them.</p>
      <p><strong>"Energy," "Vibration," "Frequency" without equations attached are noise. We do not permit noise.</strong></p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section protocol">
    <h2 class="protocol-title">On Argument</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>Before you critique a position, state it so well its holder would agree.</p>
      <p>Fallacies end the conversation. Ad hominem, circular reasoning, appeal to emotion: these are exits, not moves.</p>
      <p><strong>If the texts do not answer, if experience does not confirm, we say: we do not know. Fabricated certainty is worse than silence.</strong></p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section protocol">
    <h2 class="protocol-title">On Experience</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>Reading about water does not quench thirst.</p>
      <p><em>Parokṣa jñāna</em> (indirect knowledge) is preparation. <em>Aparokṣa</em> (direct knowing) is the point.</p>
      <p><strong>We do not mistake emotional catharsis for insight. We do not mistake intellectual satisfaction for realization.</strong></p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section protocol last">
    <h2 class="protocol-title">On This Document</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>These words are also <em>Māyā</em>. A thorn to remove a thorn.</p>
      <p><strong>When the thorn is out, we throw away both.</strong></p>
