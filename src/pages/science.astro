      Reflections on consciousness, matter, time, and information at the meeting point
      of śruti and contemporary science – without forcing either into the other's mould.

        We treat science as a method for disciplined observation and Vedānta as a method
        for disciplined self-inquiry. The aim is clarity, not synthesis for its own sake.

      <p>
        Expect careful definitions, explicit arguments, and a respectful dialogue with
        physics, chemistry, and cognitive science.
