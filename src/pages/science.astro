      Reflections on consciousness, matter, time, and information at the meeting point

        We treat science as a method for disciplined observation and Vedānta as a method
        for disciplined self-inquiry. The aim is clarity, not synthesis for its own sake.

        <h3>The Hard Problem & Cit</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Chalmers asks why there is "something it is like" to be conscious.
          Vedānta asks: who is asking? A dialogue between philosophy of mind
          and the witness-consciousness of Advaita.

        <p class="muted">
          Quantum mechanics places the observer at the heart of measurement.
          Does this vindicate Vedānta? A careful examination of what physics
          actually says – and what it doesn't.

        <h3>Time, Causation, Māyā</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Modern cosmology asks what came "before" the Big Bang. Vedānta asks
          whether time itself is fundamental. Notes on temporal illusion and
          the eternal present.

      <h2>A Note on Method</h2>
      <p>
        These reflections do not claim that ancient ṛṣis anticipated modern physics.
        Nor do they dismiss science as mere māyā. The approach here is more modest:
        to let each discipline speak in its own voice, and to notice where genuine
        resonances – and genuine differences – appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Science describes the structure of appearance with extraordinary precision.
        Vedānta inquires into the nature of the one to whom all appearance appears.
        They are not the same inquiry, but they need not be enemies.
