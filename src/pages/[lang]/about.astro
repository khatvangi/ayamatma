        This site grows from the mahāvākya “Ayam Ātmā Brahma” – this very self is Brahman –
        and from the conviction that clarity is a form of devotion.

        Here, Upaniṣadic Vedānta is explored with the tools of a scientist and philosopher:
        careful definitions, explicit arguments, and an honest dialogue with modern physics,
        chemistry, and cognitive science.
