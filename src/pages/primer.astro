      A concise introduction to Advaita Vedānta for analytically trained minds: core

      <h2>Core Terms</h2>

      <h3>Brahman</h3>
      <p>
        The infinite, unchanging reality. Not a deity, not a force – the substratum
        of all that appears. Brahman is sat-cit-ānanda: existence itself, awareness
        itself, wholeness itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Ātman</h3>
      <p>
        The self. Not the ego, not the mind, not the body – but the witness of all
        these. Vedānta's central claim: Ātman is Brahman. The individual self and
        the infinite are not two.
      </p>

      <h3>Māyā</h3>
      <p>
        The power by which the one appears as many. Not illusion in the sense of
        non-existence, but appearance that veils the underlying unity. The world
        is real as appearance, unreal as separate from Brahman.
      </p>

      <h3>Avidyā</h3>
      <p>
        Ignorance – not lack of information, but mistaking the self for what it is
        not. The root confusion: identifying with body, mind, or role rather than
        with awareness itself.

      <h2>The Four Mahāvākyas</h2>
      <p>
        Four great statements from the Upaniṣads, each pointing to the same truth
        from a different angle:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Prajñānam Brahma</strong> – Consciousness is Brahman<br/>
        <em>Aitareya Upaniṣad</em>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Ayam Ātmā Brahma</strong> – This self is Brahman<br/>
        <em>Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad</em>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Tat Tvam Asi</strong> – You are that<br/>
        <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Aham Brahmāsmi</strong> – I am Brahman<br/>
        <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Method of Inquiry</h2>

      <h3>Śravaṇa – Listening</h3>
      <p>
        Careful attention to the teaching. Not passive hearing, but active
        engagement with the words of the Upaniṣads and a qualified teacher.
      </p>

      <h3>Manana – Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Reasoning through doubts. Every objection is examined, every apparent
        contradiction resolved. The intellect must be satisfied.
      </p>

      <h3>Nididhyāsana – Contemplation</h3>
      <p>
        Sustained attention to the truth. Not meditation on an object, but
        abiding as awareness itself until the understanding becomes unshakeable.
