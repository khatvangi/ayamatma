        <strong>Advaita</strong> is as ancient as it is modern. It is as scientific as it is pragmatic. It is as much a rigorous <strong>सिद्धान्त</strong> (<em>Siddhānta</em> — Doctrine) as it is a direct <strong>अनुभव</strong> (<em>Anubhava</em> — Experience). If the knowledge of Non-Duality is a mighty ocean, all other branches of human knowledge are merely rivers destined to merge into it. It is the zenith of human intelligence and living. It is the singular resolution to every existential problem faced by humanity.
      </p>

      <h2>The Current Degradation</h2>
      <p>
        Yet, ninety percent of people today mistake this profound Knowledge for the cheap "miracles" of so-called holy men. They have reduced the status of the Guru to a mere object of <strong>पादपूजा</strong> (<em>pādapūjā</em> — worship of feet) and a dispenser of benedictions. They labour under the delusion that Vedanta consists of rituals, marks on the forehead, or cryptic mantras whispered in the ear. They assume that <strong>देवतोपासना</strong> (<em>Devatopāsanā</em> — worship of various forms) or the physical contortions of <strong>योगाभ्यास</strong> (<em>yogābhyāsa</em>) constitute the limit of spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their approach is akin to the blind men describing the elephant. They are like those who, unable to scale Mount Everest, climb a pile of rocks and declare they have conquered the summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these times, everyone who grasps a fragment of information falls into a swoon, believing they possess the ultimate Advaitic wisdom. The speakers speak to please the crowd; the listeners listen to be entertained. The teachers seek nothing but fame and financial gain; the followers seek nothing but a <strong>भगवान्</strong> (<em>Bhagavān</em>) to drop solutions into their laps without effort. They are content to serve these figures as <strong>दैव</strong> (<em>Daiva</em> — divine beings) in exchange for material gain.
      </p>
      <p class="emphasis">
        This is the naked, unvarnished truth.
      </p>

      <h2>The Harsh Truth Must Be Spoken</h2>
      <p>
        Truth is often harsh. Yet, however harsh, it must be spoken to the world. This is why the <strong>Upanishadic Rishis</strong>, desiring the welfare of the world rather than its applause, proclaimed the Truth of Advaita thousands of years ago. Commentators like <strong>Shankara Bhagavatpada</strong> reiterated this relentless Truth in their works without hesitation or compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
        That alone is true Science; that alone is the authentic <strong>गुरु-शिष्य सम्प्रदाय</strong> (<em>Guru-Śiṣya Sampradāya</em>). Only by recognizing this and molding one's life accordingly can human existence find its purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>The Royal Path Is Being Closed</h2>
      <p>
        Today, the <strong>राजमार्ग</strong> (<em>Rājamārga</em> — Royal Path) shown by the ancients is in danger of being closed off. Side alleys and dead ends are masquerading as highways. To tread these deviant paths is not beneficial; it is not the solution to life's suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intent of our movement is to expose this reality.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Firm Stance</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to articulate the pristine <strong>वेदान्त विज्ञान</strong> (<em>Vedānta Vijñāna</em>) taught by the great Commentators, harmonizing it with modern scientific logic and practical life. We have no other agenda.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="stance-block">
        <p>
          In this pursuit, we adhere to a strict definition of freedom:
        </p>
        <p class="stance-main">
          <strong>We reject the absolute authority of any person, dead or alive.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We recognize that every method — whether ritual, yoga, or meditation — has a natural, inherent scope. When a method is used within its natural limit, it is a tool.
        </p>
        <p class="stance-warning">
          <strong>But when any method is imposed beyond its natural scope, it becomes a cult and inevitably creates <em>Duḥkha</em> (suffering).</strong>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Our Service</h2>
      <p>
        Our service to you is to proclaim this without hesitation:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>परवंचना</strong> (<em>paravañcanā</em> — deceiving others) is unworthy of a teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>आत्मवंचना</strong> (<em>ātmavañcanā</em> — deceiving oneself) is fatal for a student.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, through this honesty, <strong>सम्यक् ज्ञान</strong> (<em>Samyak Jñāna</em> — Right Knowledge) dawns upon both, that is the only reward we seek.
      </p>

      <p class="begin">
        <strong>अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा</strong><br/>
        <em>Athāto Brahmajijñāsā</em><br/>
        Now, therefore, the inquiry into Brahman begins.
