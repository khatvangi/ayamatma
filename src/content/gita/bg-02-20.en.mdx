  <p>
    The verse blocks the mistake of treating the knower as a thing. It removes birth and death from the witness, not from the body.
  </p>
</VerseBlock>

## Meaning

Hold the witness as the background of experience. The verse does not claim immortality for the body or the mind, only for what cannot be objectified.

## Practice

Sit quietly for three minutes. Notice the stream of thoughts. Ask, "What is aware of this stream?" Do not answer with an object.
