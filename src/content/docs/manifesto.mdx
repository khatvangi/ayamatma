# Manifesto

Ayamatma is a disciplined practice in reading, reasoning, and living. We test claims. We keep the text close. We avoid performance.

## Protocols

1. **Text first.** Begin with the verse, keep the language visible, and resist paraphrase drift.
2. **Argument next.** State the claim and the reasoning clearly, with objections in view.
3. **Practice always.** Each insight must end in a direct, repeatable practice.
4. **No fog.** Avoid word-salad and hand-waving. Precision over comfort.
5. **Revision is a virtue.** Versions are public. Corrections are welcome.
