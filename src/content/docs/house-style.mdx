# House Style

## Lexicon rule

Avoid Abrahamic microcopy in UI labels. Do not use terms like "soul", "sin", "salvation", "grace", or "prayer" unless explicitly defined on a content page.

Preferred terms: atman, jiva, moksha, avidya, pramana, sadhana, nididhyasana (with English in parentheses on first use).

## Science boundary

No quantum mysticism. No vague "energy" or "vibration" claims. If a statement cannot be tested or clarified, rewrite it.

## Translation rule

On first use, show the Sanskrit term and the English gloss in parentheses. Keep the Sanskrit term consistent across the site.

## Tone

Direct, precise, and calm. If a sentence does not add clarity, remove it.
