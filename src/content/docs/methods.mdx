# Methods

Ayamatma follows a simple method: verse, claim, reasoning, practice.

- **Verse.** Keep the original language visible and stable.
- **Claim.** State what the verse asserts without embellishment.
- **Reasoning.** Provide the argument and list objections.
- **Practice.** Offer a small, repeatable action to test the claim.
