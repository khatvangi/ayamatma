## The common misreading

"<Term iast="vedānta">Vedānta</Term> says the world is an illusion." This is the standard Western summary, and it is
almost entirely wrong.

The snake-rope analogy is frequently cited: you see a snake, but it's actually a rope.
Therefore, the world is like the snake — merely imagined.

But this misses the point entirely.

## What <Term iast="māyā">māyā</Term> actually means

<Term iast="māyā">Māyā</Term> is the power by which the one appears as many. It is not that the many are fake —
they are real *as appearances*. The rope is real. The perception is real. What is
"unreal" is only the snake *as a snake separate from the rope*.

> The world is not denied. Only its independent existence is denied.

## <Term iast="vyāvahārika">Vyāvahārika</Term> and <Term iast="pāramārthika">pāramārthika</Term>

<Term iast="vedānta">Vedānta</Term> distinguishes levels of reality:

- **<Term iast="vyāvahārika">Vyāvahārika</Term>** (transactional): The world as we navigate it daily. Real for all
  practical purposes.
- **<Term iast="pāramārthika">Pāramārthika</Term>** (ultimate): The world seen as non-different from <Term iast="brahman">Brahman</Term>. Still
  appearing, but known as appearance.

The world doesn't vanish upon realization. It is seen truly for the first time.

## The practical test

If someone claims the world is illusion, ask them to walk through a wall. The teaching
is subtler than simple denial.
