Where is the <Term iast="śivaliṅga">Shiva Lingam</Term> located within the sanctum of a temple, and upon what does it rest? It sits firmly upon the pedestal known as the **पाणिवट्टम्** (*pāṇivaṭṭam*).

Do you understand what this पाणिवट्टम् represents? It is the embodiment of **<Term iast="prāṇa">प्राण</Term>** (*prāṇa*—the vital life force). And what of the Lingam itself? The **<Term iast="liṅga">लिंग</Term>** (*liṅga*) is the **<Term iast="manas">मनस्</Term>** (*manas*—the mind). That Shiva is the Supreme Soul, the **<Term iast="paramātmā">परमात्मा</Term>** (*paramātmā*). For this Supreme Soul, the Lingam serves as a signifier; it is the mind that indicates the presence of the <Term iast="paramātmā">Paramatma</Term> to us.

The very word "<Term iast="liṅga">Linga</Term>" means an indication or a sign—**लिङ्ग्यते अनेन इति लिङ्गम्** (*liṅgyate anena iti liṅgam*)—"that by which something is indicated." It is your mind that reveals the existence of the <Term iast="paramātmā">Paramatma</Term>; therefore, the mind is the Lingam, the **<Term iast="śivaliṅga">शिवलिंग</Term>** (*śivaliṅga*) representing the Supreme Soul.

Upon what does this mind depend? It relies entirely on **<Term iast="prāṇa">प्राण</Term>** (*prāṇa*). Without the life force, the mind ceases to function. Because <Term iast="prāṇa">Prana</Term> is the foundational support for the mind, the Panavattam forms the base, and the <Term iast="śivaliṅga">Shiva Lingam</Term> is consecrated above it.

Do you realize the depth of this inner meaning? This is magnificent symbolism that one must truly grasp. The temple architecture itself encodes the deepest truths of <Term iast="vedānta">Vedanta</Term>: the mind, supported by the vital force, pointing toward the Supreme Reality that pervades all.
