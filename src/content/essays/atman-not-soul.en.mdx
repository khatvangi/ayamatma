## The translation trap

When we say <TermChip term="atman" definition="The witness, not an object of experience." href="/glossary/atman" /> is the "soul" or the "self," we import Western baggage that the text does not require. The Gita is precise: the knower is not an object of knowledge.

<VerseBlock
  ref="BG 2.20"
  devanagari="न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचित् नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः"
  iast="na jāyate mriyate vā kadācit nāyaṃ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ"
  translation="It is never born, nor does it die; having been, it never ceases to be."
>
  <p>
    The verse does not point to a hidden entity inside the mind. It points to what cannot be made into an object at all.
  </p>
</VerseBlock>

## What the text permits

We can say: the witness is not born, does not die, and is not an object of experience. We cannot say: it is a personal soul that survives in a moral ledger.

## Objections

- "Isn't this just semantics?" Only if you allow the wrong translation to drive the claim.
- "But tradition uses the word soul." Tradition uses atman, and that difference matters.

## What would change my mind

If a verse or commentary establishes atman as a personal, psychological entity, I will revise the claim.

## Version notes

- v1.0 — initial publication.
