## The false dichotomy

There is a persistent myth: that spiritual inquiry requires abandoning rigorous thought.
That analysis is cold, and devotion is warm. That the intellect must be bypassed to reach
the heart.

<Term iast="vedānta">Vedānta</Term> disagrees.

## <Term iast="śaṅkara">Śaṅkara</Term>'s razor

<Term iast="śaṅkara">Ādi Śaṅkarācārya</Term>'s commentaries are ruthlessly precise. He defines terms, distinguishes
meanings, and dismantles sloppy thinking with care. This is not intellectual arrogance —
it is intellectual humility. He refuses to let confusion masquerade as mystery.

> The intellect must be satisfied before it can be transcended.

## What clarity requires

- **Honesty**: Not pretending to understand what you don't
- **Patience**: Sitting with a question until it resolves
- **Surrender**: Letting go of preferred conclusions when they don't hold

This is devotion. Not to a concept, but to what is actually true.

## The paradox

The sharpest analysis eventually recognizes its own limits. The intellect, used properly,
discovers that the one who analyzes cannot itself be analyzed. This is not defeat — it is
arrival.
