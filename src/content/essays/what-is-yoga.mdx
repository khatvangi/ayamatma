"Yoga" is one of those terms we hear constantly, yet the frequency with which it strikes our ears is matched only by the rarity with which its true meaning penetrates our minds. We struggle to pin it down with any precision. In casual conversation, we inquire about a person's well-being using the compound word *yogakṣema*; we remark that someone has "good yoga" (meaning luck) or "bad yoga." The domain of this word is vast, stretching from such colloquialisms to the rigorous scriptural pursuit of *yogasiddhi* (योगसिद्धि). Yet, we often remain oblivious to the specific context in which we employ the term. Even within authoritative texts, the concept remains elusive.

## The Kaleidoscope of the Gita

In the [Bhagavad Gita](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/), the sage Vyasa classifies all eighteen chapters as eighteen distinct Yogas. It is curious that while the subject matter shifts from chapter to chapter, he labels every aspect—despondency, action, knowledge, and wisdom—as Yoga. How is this possible?

Furthermore, the Maharishi offers varying definitions throughout the text:

### Skill in Action
<div class="verse-block">

**बुद्धियुक्तो जहातीह उभे सुकृतदुष्कृते ।
तस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् ॥**

*buddhiyukto jahātīha ubhe sukṛtaduṣkṛte*
*tasmādyogāya yujyasva yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam*

"Endowed with wisdom, one sheds both good and evil deeds. Therefore, devote yourself to Yoga—**Yoga is skill in action.**"

— [Bhagavad Gita 2.50](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=2&field_nsutra_value=50)

</div>

### Equanimity
<div class="verse-block">

**योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय ।
सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ॥**

*yogasthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṃ tyaktvā dhanañjaya*
*siddhyasiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṃ yoga ucyate*

"Established in Yoga, perform actions, abandoning attachment, O Dhananjaya. Remain the same in success and failure—**equanimity is called Yoga.**"

— [Bhagavad Gita 2.48](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=2&field_nsutra_value=48)

</div>

### Divine Assurance
<div class="verse-block">

**अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते ।
तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ॥**

*ananyāścintayanto māṃ ye janāḥ paryupāsate*
*teṣāṃ nityābhiyuktānāṃ yogakṣemaṃ vahāmyaham*

"Those who worship Me alone, thinking of no other, to those ever-united souls, **I provide what they lack and preserve what they have.**"

— [Bhagavad Gita 9.22](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=9&field_nsutra_value=22)

</div>

### Severance from Sorrow
<div class="verse-block">

**तं विद्याद् दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम् ।
स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा ॥**

*taṃ vidyād duḥkhasaṃyogaviyogaṃ yogasaṃjñitam*
*sa niścayena yoktavyo yogo'nirviṇṇacetasā*

"Know that which is called Yoga to be **the severance of union with sorrow.** This Yoga should be practiced with determination and an undismayed mind."

— [Bhagavad Gita 6.23](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=6&field_nsutra_value=23)

</div>

### Knowledge into Experience
<div class="verse-block">

**लोकेऽस्मिन् द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयानघ ।
ज्ञानयोगेन साङ्ख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् ॥**

*loke'smin dvividhā niṣṭhā purā proktā mayānagha*
*jñānayogena sāṅkhyānāṃ karmayogena yoginām*

"In this world, O sinless one, a twofold path was taught by Me of old: the path of knowledge (*jñānayoga*) for the contemplative, and the path of action (*karmayoga*) for the active."

— [Bhagavad Gita 3.3](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=3&field_nsutra_value=3)

</div>

The great commentator Adi Shankara clarifies in his [Bhashya](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=3&field_nsutra_value=3&scsh=1) that while *jñāna* is knowledge derived from scripture, *yoga* is the process of bringing that knowledge into one's direct personal experience.

## Patanjali's Precision

If the Bhagavad Gita presents such a kaleidoscope of meanings, the situation is even more specific in the work of Patanjali, who authored the [Yoga Sutras](https://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras.htm)—a treatise dedicated entirely to the science of Yoga.

Among the six orthodox schools of philosophy (*ṣaḍdarśana*), Kapila's *Sāṃkhya* (सांख्य) is atheistic, whereas Patanjali's Yoga is theistic. Patanjali's Darshana is authoritative and serves as the foundation for all subsequent Yoga literature.

At the very outset, he defines the essential characteristic of the practice:

<div class="verse-block">

**योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥**

*yogaścittavṛttinirodhaḥ*

"**Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind.**"

— [Yoga Sutras 1.2](https://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-10104.htm#1.2)

</div>

To achieve this, he outlines the eight distinct stages known as *aṣṭāṅga yoga* (अष्टांग योग):

<div class="verse-block">

**यमनियमासनप्राणायामप्रत्याहारधारणाध्यानसमाधयोऽष्टावङ्गानि ॥**

*yamaniyamāsanaprāṇāyāmapratyāhāradhāraṇādhyānasamādhayo'ṣṭāvaṅgāni*

"The eight limbs are: *yama* (restraints), *niyama* (observances), *āsana* (posture), *prāṇāyāma* (breath control), *pratyāhāra* (withdrawal), *dhāraṇā* (concentration), *dhyāna* (meditation), and *samādhi* (absorption)."

— [Yoga Sutras 2.29](https://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-22829.htm#2.29)

</div>

## The Problem of Contradiction

With so many luminaries describing it in so many ways, we are left wondering: **What is the authentic meaning of Yoga?**

We cannot simply say all definitions are valid, as they often appear contradictory. As long as contradictions persist, synthesis is impossible. Without synthesis, there is no decisive knowledge. Without decisive knowledge, there is no practice, and without practice, there is no attainment.

Therefore, we must now inquire if there is a unifying thread—a synthesis—that ties all these concepts together.

---

## Etymology: The Root *yuj*

To understand any word as it truly is, we must trace it to its etymological root. The word "Yoga" is derived from the root *yuj* (युज्), meaning **"to join."** Thus, historically, Yoga implies a union.

Union is only possible when there are two entities:
- If both entities are imperfect, their union is fruitless.
- If both are perfect, there is no need for them to join.
- The concept of union becomes meaningful only when one is imperfect and the other is perfect.

As the *śānti mantra* of the [Īśā Upaniṣad](https://upanishads.org.in/upanishads/1) declares:

<div class="verse-block">

**ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥**

*oṃ pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidaṃ pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate*
*pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate*

"That is Whole. This is Whole. From the Whole, the Whole arises. **When the Whole is taken from the Whole, the Whole alone remains.**"

— [Īśāvāsya Upaniṣad, Śānti Mantra](https://upanishads.org.in/upanishads/1)

</div>

This realization is the singular solution to all of life's problems.

## The Imperfect and the Perfect

The question then arises: What is the current imperfection, and what is the perfect Reality one must attain?

The imperfection is nothing other than the human mind. The world perceived by this mind is also imperfect. Furthermore, even *īśvara* (ईश्वर—God) conceived as a being transcending these is, in a philosophical sense, imperfect.

The reason is that all three are "particulars" or "specific forms" (*viśeṣa*, विशेष). A specific form is always limited. The *sāmānya* (सामान्य—Universal) that permeates them is the Perfect.

One specific cannot be born from another specific; all specifics arise from the Universal, are filled with it, and eventually dissolve back into it. Therefore, the specifics are not different from the Universal; the Universal simply appears to our vision as specific forms.

We can understand this through the analogy of **gold and jewelry**—the gold is the substance (Universal), while the ornaments are mere appearances (particulars). Thus, nothing is truly imperfect; all is essentially Perfect.

---

## The Triad and the Great Universal

Currently, the triad of the Individual (*jīva*, जीव), the World (*jagat*, जगत्), and God (*īśvara*, ईश्वर) are specifics, and thus, on their own, appear imperfect.

To elaborate:
- The **Jīva** is a particularization of Consciousness (*cidviśeṣa*, चिद्विशेष)
- The **Jagat** is a particularization of Existence (*sadviśeṣa*, सद्विशेष)
- **Īśvara** occupies a middle ground between the two

If these three are specifics, what is the Universal that permeates them all?

It is the flash of awareness:

<div class="verse-block">

**अहमस्मि**

*ahamasmi*

"**I am.**"

</div>

This is not the thought "I am so-and-so," and thus it is not specific Consciousness (*cidviśeṣa*); it is Universal Consciousness (*citsāmānya*, चित्सामान्य). Similarly, it is not "existing as a specific object," and thus it is not specific Existence (*sadviśeṣa*); it is Universal Existence (*satsāmānya*, सत्सामान्य).

Because it permeates all three, philosophers have termed it the **mahāsāmānya** (महासामान्य)—the Great Universal. Another name for this is the **Ātmā** (आत्मा). It is of the nature of Existence-Consciousness (*Sat-Cit*).

In this, the specifics of Jīva, Jagat, and Īśvara merge and become one, just as waves, bubbles, and foam dissolve into the ocean. Here, there is not even a trace of imperfection. It is the singular, unified, Perfect Reality.

---

## The Synthesis

If we attain this, it is sufficient. That is the true "Yoga" we must catch.

- Because it is the state where the Universal and the particular become one, it is true **samatvam** (समत्वम्—equanimity). *[BG 2.48]*

- Because no action performed with this vision binds the doer, it is true **karmasu kauśalam** (कर्मसु कौशलम्—skill in action). *[BG 2.50]*

- In this state, all mental fluctuations related to specific forms vanish on their own; thus, it is the ultimate **cittavṛttinirodhaḥ** (चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः). *[YS 1.2]*

- Finally, if grasped intellectually, this is scriptural knowledge; when it transforms into direct experience, it is self-realization.

In this complete experience of the Ātmā, there is no misfortune (*anartha*, अनर्थ) of the non-self. Therefore, this is the supreme human goal (*puruṣārtha*, पुरुषार्थ).
