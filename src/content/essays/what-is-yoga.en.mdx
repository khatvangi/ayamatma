import Term from '../../components/Term.astro';

"<Term iast="yoga">Yoga</Term>" is one of those terms we hear constantly, yet the frequency with which it strikes our ears is matched only by the rarity with which its true meaning penetrates our minds. We struggle to pin it down with any precision. In casual conversation, we inquire about a person's well-being using the compound word <Term iast="yogakṣema">yogakṣema</Term>; we remark that someone has "good yoga" (meaning luck) or "bad yoga." The domain of this word is vast, stretching from such colloquialisms to the rigorous scriptural pursuit of योगसिद्धि (<Term iast="yogasiddhi">yogasiddhi</Term>). Yet, we often remain oblivious to the specific context in which we employ the term. Even within authoritative texts, the concept remains elusive.

## The Kaleidoscope of the Gita

In the Bhagavad Gita, the sage <Term iast="vyāsa">Vyāsa</Term> classifies all eighteen chapters as eighteen distinct Yogas. It is curious that while the subject matter shifts from chapter to chapter, he labels every aspect—despondency, action, knowledge, and wisdom—as <Term iast="yoga">Yoga</Term>. How is this possible? Furthermore, the Maharishi offers varying definitions throughout the text. At one point, he declares योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="bg-2-50">(*yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam*)</span>—Yoga is skill in action. Elsewhere, he states समत्वं योग उच्यते <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="bg-2-48">(*samatvaṃ yoga ucyate*)</span>—equanimity, viewing the dualities of pleasure and pain without distinction, is called <Term iast="yoga">Yoga</Term>. In another verse, the Lord promises योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="bg-9-22">(*yogakṣemaṃ vahāmyaham*)</span>—I shall provide both attainment and preservation. Perhaps most poetically, <Term iast="vyāsa">Vyāsa</Term> describes it as दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम् <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="bg-6-23">(*duḥkhasaṃyogaviyogaṃ yogasaṃjñitam*)</span>—Yoga is the severance of the union with sorrow. Finally, when <Term iast="vyāsa">Vyāsa</Term> uses the phrase ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="bg-3-3">(*jñānayogavyavasthitiḥ*)</span>, the great commentator <Term iast="śaṅkara">Ādi Śaṅkara</Term> clarifies that while <Term iast="jñāna">jñāna</Term> is knowledge derived from scripture, <Term iast="yoga">yoga</Term> is the process of bringing that knowledge into one's direct personal experience.

## Patanjali's Precision

If the Bhagavad Gita presents such a kaleidoscope of meanings, the situation is even more specific in the work of <Term iast="patañjali">Patañjali</Term>, who authored the treatise dedicated entirely to the science of <Term iast="yoga">Yoga</Term>. Among the six orthodox schools of philosophy, Kapila's <Term iast="sāṃkhya">Sāṃkhya</Term> is atheistic, whereas <Term iast="patañjali">Patañjali</Term>'s <Term iast="yoga">Yoga</Term> is theistic. <Term iast="patañjali">Patañjali</Term>'s <Term iast="darśana">Darśana</Term> (philosophy) is authoritative and serves as the foundation for all subsequent Yoga literature. At the very outset, he defines the essential characteristic of the practice: योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="ys-1-2">(*yogaścittavṛttinirodhaḥ*)</span>. <Term iast="yoga">Yoga</Term> is the restraint and cessation of the fluctuating patterns of the mind. To achieve this, he outlines the eight distinct stages known as <Term iast="aṣṭāṅgayoga">aṣṭāṅga yoga</Term> <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="ys-2-29">(*aṣṭāṅga yoga*)</span>, ranging from ethical precepts like <Term iast="yama">yama</Term> and <Term iast="niyama">niyama</Term> to concentration, meditation, and finally, <Term iast="samādhi">samādhi</Term>.

## The Problem of Contradiction

With so many luminaries describing it in so many ways, we are left wondering: What is the authentic meaning of Yoga? We cannot simply say all definitions are valid, as they often appear contradictory. As long as contradictions persist, synthesis is impossible. Without synthesis, there is no decisive knowledge. Without decisive knowledge, there is no practice, and without practice, there is no attainment. Therefore, we must now inquire if there is a unifying thread—a synthesis—that ties all these concepts together.

## Etymology: The Root युज्

To understand any word as it truly is, we must trace it to its etymological root. The word योग (*yoga*) is derived from the Sanskrit root युज् (*yuj*), meaning "to join." Through grammatical transformation, युज् becomes योग—the ज (*j*) of the root softening to ग (*g*) in the derived noun. Thus, historically, Yoga implies a union. Union is only possible when there are two entities. If both entities are imperfect, their union is fruitless. If both are perfect, there is no need for them to join. The concept of union becomes meaningful only when one is imperfect and the other is perfect. As the mantra says, पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते <span class="verse-ref" data-verse="isa-shanti">(*pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate*)</span>—when the Whole is realized, the individual finds completion. This realization is the singular solution to all of life's problems.

## The Imperfect and the Perfect

The question then arises: What is the current imperfection, and what is the perfect Reality one must attain? The imperfection is nothing other than the human mind. The world perceived by this mind is also imperfect. Furthermore, even the <Term iast="īśvara">Īśvara</Term> (God) conceived as a being transcending these is, in a philosophical sense, imperfect. The reason is that all three are "particulars" or "specific forms" (<Term iast="viśeṣa">viśeṣa</Term>). A specific form is always limited. The <Term iast="sāmānya">sāmānya</Term> (Universal) that permeates them is the Perfect. One specific cannot be born from another specific; all specifics arise from the Universal, are filled with it, and eventually dissolve back into it. Therefore, the specifics are not different from the Universal; the Universal simply appears to our vision as specific forms. We can understand this through the analogy of gold and jewelry—the gold is the substance (Universal), while the ornaments are mere appearances (particulars). Thus, nothing is truly imperfect; all is essentially Perfect.

## The Triad and the Great Universal

Currently, the triad of the Individual (<Term iast="jīva">Jīva</Term>), the World (<Term iast="jagat">Jagat</Term>), and God (<Term iast="īśvara">Īśvara</Term>) are specifics, and thus, on their own, appear imperfect. To elaborate: the <Term iast="jīva">Jīva</Term> is a particularization of Consciousness (<Term iast="cidviśeṣa">cidviśeṣa</Term>). The perceptible World is a particularization of Existence (<Term iast="sadviśeṣa">sadviśeṣa</Term>). <Term iast="īśvara">Īśvara</Term> occupies a middle ground. If we consider specific Consciousness, it aligns with the <Term iast="jīva">Jīva</Term>; if we consider specific Existence, it aligns with the World. If these three are specifics, what is the Universal that permeates them all?

It is the flash of awareness: अहमस्मि (*ahamasmi*)—"I am." This is not the thought "I am so-and-so," and thus it is not specific Consciousness (<Term iast="cidviśeṣa">cidviśeṣa</Term>); it is Universal Consciousness (<Term iast="citsāmānya">citsāmānya</Term>). Similarly, it is not "existing as a specific object," and thus it is not specific Existence (<Term iast="sadviśeṣa">sadviśeṣa</Term>); it is Universal Existence (<Term iast="satsāmānya">satsāmānya</Term>). Because it permeates all three, philosophers have termed it the <Term iast="mahāsāmānya">mahāsāmānya</Term>—the Great Universal. Another name for this is the <Term iast="ātman">Ātmā</Term>. It is of the nature of Existence-Consciousness (<Term iast="sat">Sat</Term>-<Term iast="cit">Cit</Term>). In this, the specifics of <Term iast="jīva">Jīva</Term>, <Term iast="jagat">Jagat</Term>, and <Term iast="īśvara">Īśvara</Term> merge and become one, just as waves, bubbles, and foam dissolve into the ocean. Here, there is not even a trace of imperfection. It is the singular, unified, Perfect Reality.

## The Synthesis

If we attain this, it is sufficient. That is the true "<Term iast="yoga">Yoga</Term>" we must catch. Because it is the state where the Universal and the particular become one, it is true <Term iast="samatva">samatvam</Term> (equanimity). Because no action performed with this vision binds the doer, it is true <Term iast="karmakauśala">karmasu kauśalam</Term> (skill in action). In this state, all mental fluctuations related to specific forms vanish on their own; thus, it is the ultimate <Term iast="cittavṛttinirodha">cittavṛttinirodhaḥ</Term>. Finally, if grasped intellectually, this is scriptural knowledge; when it transforms into direct experience, it is self-realization. In this complete experience of the <Term iast="ātman">Ātmā</Term>, there is no misfortune (<Term iast="anartha">anartha</Term>) of the non-self. Therefore, this is the supreme human goal (<Term iast="puruṣārtha">puruṣārtha</Term>).
