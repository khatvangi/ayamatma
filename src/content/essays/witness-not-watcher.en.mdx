## The subtle error

When <Term iast="vedānta">Vedānta</Term> speaks of the <Term iast="sākṣī">sākṣin</Term> — the witness — it is easy to imagine a little homunculus
inside the head, peering out at experience. A watcher behind the eyes.

This is precisely wrong.

## What the texts actually say

The witness is not located anywhere. It does not have a position from which it watches.
It is not an object among objects, however subtle.

> The eye cannot see itself. The witness cannot witness itself as an object.

The <Term iast="bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣad">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</Term> is explicit: "You cannot see the seer of seeing, hear the
hearer of hearing, think the thinker of thinking."

## Presence, not entity

Better to say: the witness is the presence in which all experience appears. Not a thing
that is present, but presence itself. Not awareness *of* something, but awareness as such.

## Why this matters

If you look for the witness as an object, you will never find it — and you will conclude
it doesn't exist. But the looking itself is happening *in* the witness. The search is
already the answer, misrecognized.

## A pointer

Stop looking for what is aware. Notice that looking is already appearing in awareness.
Rest there.
