## Lessons Learned

### Design

1. **"Zen" doesn't mean "dead"** — Initial organic theme was too flat/monotone. Calm meditation sites (Calm, Headspace) use subtle gradients, soft glows, and color variation while maintaining minimalism.

2. **Typography matters** — Lora was too "bookish/literary." Fraunces + DM Sans pairing feels more contemporary and calm. Serif for headings/body, clean sans for UI elements.

3. **Shadows create depth** — Flat cards feel cheap. Layered shadows (`shadow-medium`, `shadow-glow`) with slight color tint create floating, premium feel.

4. **Gradients add life** — Background gradient (cream → sage), card top borders (warm → cool), section backgrounds break monotony without being loud.

5. **Dark mode is expected** — Users want manual toggle, not just system preference. Store choice in localStorage.

### Content

1. **Translation precision matters** — "Ātman is Brahman" not "Self is Brahman" — we wrote an essay arguing Ātman ≠ soul/self! Consistency with content is critical.

2. **Placeholder content should be real** — Lorem ipsum feels dead. Real Vedānta content (even as placeholders) makes the site feel alive and purposeful.

3. **Images transform perception** — The red tree, geometric tree, and logo images completely changed site feel from "boring" to "beautiful."

### Technical

1. **Theme system via CSS variables** — Easy to swap themes by changing one import line. All themes preserved for rollback.

2. **Audio hosting is tricky** — External CDN URLs break. Options: local hosting (reliable), or use known-stable sources like Mixkit.

3. **Keep all versions** — Never delete old themes. User changed mind multiple times. Having `theme-subtle`, `theme-bold`, `theme-organic`, `theme-editorial`, `theme-zen` allows instant rollback.

### Philosophy & Process (Jan 2026)

1. **Practice what you preach** — If the manifesto says "use Sanskrit terms with definitions," do it. Changed "Through rigorous debate" to "In vāda after vāda" with inline definition. Consistency builds trust.

2. **Manifesto without enforcement is decoration** — Added required `protocols` fields to every essay in CMS: claim, terms, fallacy, steel_man, practice. Can't publish without answering. The manifesto is now infrastructure, not just words.

3. **Dictionary grows organically** — Every term defined on the site should go into `/dictionary`. Added "ayamatma" as a source alongside "paribhasha". When you use a term, define it, then add it to dictionary.

4. **The gate is the sūtra** — Splash screen replaced with "Jijñāsā is ānanda" (The desire to know is bliss). One sūtra, one truth, one entry point. Not a Voltaire quote — our own philosophy.

5. **Clear paths, not hidden content** — Landing page must show ALL navigation: Primer, Essays, Science, Dictionary, Manifesto. If visitors don't see it, it doesn't exist.

6. **Simpler is stronger** — Contributor template went from 6 detailed fields to 1 sūtra. Manifesto went from verbose explanations to punchy statements. "Energy, Vibration, Frequency without equations are noise. We do not permit noise."

7. **GitHub OAuth without external providers** — Cloudflare Pages Functions (`/auth`, `/callback`) handle OAuth directly. No Netlify dependency. Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in Cloudflare env vars.

8. **CMS requires redeploy after env vars** — Environment variables only apply to NEW deployments. Always redeploy after adding secrets.

### WebRTC & Real-time Features (Jan 2026)

1. **STUN is not enough** — When peers are behind different NATs (different households), STUN only helps discover public IPs. You need TURN servers to relay the actual media. Free option: `openrelay.metered.ca`.

2. **Autoplay is blocked by browsers** — Creating `<audio>` or `<video>` elements with `autoplay=true` doesn't work. Browsers silently block it. Must call `.play()` explicitly and catch the rejection, then show "Tap to enable audio" button for user gesture.

3. **localStorage is browser-local** — Cannot use localStorage for cross-device features like peer discovery. If user A saves their peer ID to localStorage, user B on another device can't see it. Use server-side storage (R2) for shared state.

4. **Peer discovery needs server coordination** — Even with PeerJS, you need a way to tell peers about each other. Our solution: R2-backed API that peers poll for room state.

5. **ICE connection states matter** — Monitor `peerConnection.oniceconnectionstatechange` and show visual feedback (🔄 checking, ✅ connected, ❌ failed). Users need to see what's happening, not "it's all blind."

6. **Waiting room = server-side admission** — For invitation-only rooms, store `{ hostPeerId, waiting: [], admitted: [] }` in R2. Guests poll until admitted. Host sees waiting list and admits/rejects.

7. **PeerJS simplifies but configure ICE** — `new Peer(id)` uses defaults which often fail. Always pass `{ config: { iceServers: [...] } }` with STUN + TURN servers.

8. **Graceful degradation** — If video fails, show avatar. If audio blocked, show unlock button. Don't fail silently.

9. **sendBeacon for cleanup** — On `beforeunload`, use `navigator.sendBeacon()` to notify server of departure. Regular `fetch` may not complete during page unload.

10. **Recording mixes all streams** — To record a call, create `AudioContext`, connect all streams (local + remote) to a `MediaStreamDestination`, then use `MediaRecorder` on that mixed stream.

## Philosophy

> "Clarity is a form of devotion."

This site exists to explore Vedānta with the rigor of a scientist and the precision of a philosopher. No watering down for Western audiences, no assuming Sanskrit fluency. A third path: fidelity to source texts in language anyone can understand.

DISTILLED_AESTHETICS_PROMPT = """
<frontend_aesthetics>
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight. Focus on:

Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.

Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.

Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!
